**FliX DitroniX Power Energy Monitors Firmware**

------------

This folder supports FliX, which is an Integrated Firmware Development Code for DitroniX Power Energy Monitor SDK Boards

  Remember!
  - Set the BOARD to ESP32, 'WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32' DEV Module (or similar).
  - You may set the BAUD rate to 921600 to speed up flashing.
  - The SDK boards do NOT need external power to flash.  It will take Power from the USB 5V.
  
Note: In the default state, upon first power up and during reset, the Green LED may be partially lit. Once programmed and the GPIO defined, the Green LED will go off after power up.

This test code is OPEN SOURCE and formatted for easier viewing. It may be freely used, or modified as needed. You may use as is, use for bring-up development, simply use the bits you like! final use and for full IoT publishing. It is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
