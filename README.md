## FliX and FliX Plus - DitroniX Power Energy Monitors Firmware

The **IPEM** and **IPEC** Development Code contains a number of features, which may be either used purely for development, a basis for your own firmware, or with features enabled (via software switches), provide a complete firmware solution, publishing to the outside World.

In addition, the new **[IPEM PiHat](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEM-PiHat-IoT-Power-Energy-Monitor)** has also been launched Q1 2025.  Whilst these boards are directed towards the Raspberry Pi, due to the ease of interfacing and in order to exercise and fully test these, I took a version of **FLiX** and made a number of changes in order to drive these newer boards via an ESP32 Interposer.  This version of **FLiX** is called **FLIX Plus**.

This firmware has evolved over time and although originally was purely for bring-up testing, it has expanded into much more. It has developed way past its original bring-up task and is now quite comprehensive.  It is though, still work in progress and free to be adapted and used.

This test code is OPEN SOURCE and formatted for easier viewing. It may be freely used, or modified as needed. You may use as is, use for bring-up development, simply use the bits you like! final use and for full IoT publishing. It is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

To make it easier to manage and describe, the firmware variants (ESP32 ATM90E32 ATM90E36 Test Code), has been given a new name â€“ **Flix**

**Board Selection**

With the family addition of the [IPEC](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEC-IoT-Power-Energy-Controller) board and [IPEX](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEX-IoT-Power-Energy-Controller-Expansion-Board) Expansion, the original firmware has moved away from just [IPEM](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEM-PiHat-IoT-Power-Energy-Monitor) into an integrated development branch - with auto board detect. This will allow for future expansion and system integration.

The **FliX** firmware currently supports the below board variants:

-   **IPEM IoT Power Energy Monitor**
    -   IPEM32E-M90E32-INT \| ESP32-WROOM-32E ATM90E32 AT24C64
    -   IPEM32UE-M90E32-EXT \| ESP32-WROOM-32UE ATM90E32 AT24C64
    -   IPEM32E-M90E36-INT \| ESP32-WROOM-32E ATM90E36 AT24C64
    -   IPEM32UE-M90E36-EXT \| ESP32-WROOM-32UE ATM90E36 AT24C64
-   **IPEC IoT Power Energy Controller**
    -   IPEC32E-M90E32-INT \| ESP32-WROOM-32E ATM90E32 MSP4728 AT24C64
    -   IPEC32UE-M90E32-EXT \| ESP32-WROOM-32UE ATM90E32 AT24C64
-   **IPEX-1 IoT Power Energy Controller Expansion**
    -   IPEX1-ACS758-ADS1115 \| ACS758 ADS1115 PCA9685

The **FliX Plus** beta firmware currently supports the below board variants:

   -   **[IPEM PiHat](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEM-PiHat-IoT-Power-Energy-Monitor)** ATM90E36 via ESP32 Interposer.  WIP: ADC, DAC, RTC, Stacking.
   -   **[IPEM PiHat Lite](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEM-PiHat-IoT-Power-Energy-Monitor)** ATM90E36 via ESP32 Interposer.  WIP: ADC, DAC, RTC, Stacking.

**Continual Development**

Due to the nature of this firmware, **FliX** and **FliX Plus** remains under development and is subject to change, improvements and additions.

During any development, the firmware is carefully tested on the range of supported boards. However, should you notice a gremlin, please feel free to let us know!

**The Future**

The longer term ideal, is for **FliX** to be streamlined even further and revamped, for example contain a single configuration file etc.
